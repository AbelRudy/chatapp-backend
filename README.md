# Chatapp
In order to learn [socket.io](https://socket.io/), I made this project with Node.js, Express and MongoDB for the backend, and React Native with Expo for the [frontend](https://github.com/AbelRudy/chatapp-frontend)
## Installation
To install this backend project, you just have to :
- Clone the repository
- Install all dependencies
```bash
npm install
```
- Run the project in dev mode
```bash
npm run dev
```
